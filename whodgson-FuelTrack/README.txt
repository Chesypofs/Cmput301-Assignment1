Video showing working app: https://youtu.be/8MKr_bkxoTo

Note: In the video we are supposed to enter non-numeric data for
      the odometer and check that it recognizes it. Part of how
      my app is designed is that it forces the user to use the 
      number pad for numeric data, therefore the only way a user
      can enter non-numeric data when numeric data is required
      is by entering a period (.), which is what is shown in the
      video.
